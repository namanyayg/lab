              - if (c.key == "kevin")
                p It has been a dream of mine to create a bot that could write code for me <em>(so I could delegate the boilerplate and focus on the creative parts of programming)</em>.
                p Seeing Devin made me realize that my teenage dream is close to becoming reality. For personal satisfaction, I embarked on making my own open-source interface.
                p The name comes from the legendary phreaker and my childhood hero <strong>Kevin Mitnick</strong> and is a play on Cognition Labs&rsquo; product name.

              - if (c.key == "webstiles")
                p I made webstiles around the time when I first started working on client projects. Webstiles was born out of a need to have an easy to understand and easy to use way to share design prototyping ideas with clients.
                p Webstiles soon became <a href="https://nmn.gl/blog/my-workflow-when-working-with-clients">a core part of my workflow</a>. My clients loved seeing multiple different Webstiles to choose from, and it also seemed to be well-received on social media.

              - if (c.key == "indiasmile")
                p Around when COVID struck, I wanted some way for my friends and family to be informed and also some way to unwind. That's why my team and I decided to make IndiaSmile. It was  no-nonsense website that showed the latest COVID-19 statistics, a whatsapp and telgram community of 2500+ members, and ways to stay happy and healthy during the pandemic combined.
                p It went viral. At its peak, it had over <strong>6,00,000 hits</strong> per day. I enjoyed the complex challenge of rearchitecturing the backend to handle the traffic.

              - if (c.key == "lccpp")
                p I always felt frustrated at the study material for my 11<sup>th</sup> grade Computer Science course, which was an introduction to C++. I believed there was a massive improvement to be made by re-organizing the structure and steps of the course.
                p So I did just that. While finishing my 11<sup>th</sup> grade, I wrote a book called "Less Confusing C++" to teach the coursework in my style. Since the target audience was my peers, I made sure that the book is available for free.

              - if (c.key == "keyzen")
                p I made this game for a hackathon in a few hours. It was around a time when I was obssessed with improving my typing speed, following the logic that faster typing = faster programming.
                p I wanted to make soft, "biteable", pastel aesthetics. I remember that I especially enjoyed making and animating the keyboard. Keyzen took home the first prize that day.

              - if (c.key == "diode")
                p <em>&ldquo;Diode&rdquo; #{ simulatorSeriesText }</em>
                p When I first studied them, the workings of a diode and their &ldquo;depletion region&rdquo; confused me. Given how essential they are for computing, I wanted to understand them better. Making this simulation helped.

              - if (c.key == "acgen")
                p <em>&ldquo;AC Gen&rdquo; #{ simulatorSeriesText }</em>
                p Current electricity was one of my favourite topics in High School Physics. I they look beautiful while operating so I made this simulation.

              - else if (c.key == "collisions")
                p <em>&ldquo;Collisions&rdquo; #{ simulatorSeriesText }</em>
                p This one is a simulation of two dimensional elastic collisions, where I chose to demonstrate how the particles in a low density gas might collide.

              - else if (c.key == "bandc")
                p We were given the option of studying this game and produce a research paper for the <a href="https://coreisus.com/">COÐ¯E</a> hackathon. We were given only 48 hours to prepare it. 
                p My co-founder <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/adityag9">Aditya</a> and I figured out the working for the game and the optimal algorithms to solve it, and drafted a <a href="https://vixra.org/pdf/1601.0302v1.pdf">quick research paper</a> (using LaTeX for the first time here was a pleasant experience and it introduced me to a new tool).
                p After figuring out the game&rsquo;s algorithms, I decided to code it up as a JavaScript game for a demo, as I am always fond of practical explanations vs text.
                p We took home the first prize that day.

              - else if (c.key == "acgraphs")
                p <em>&ldquo;AC Graphs&rdquo; #{ simulatorSeriesText }</em>
                p I loved the idea of the components of an AC circuit always being out of phase and how beautiful their graphs looked. Plus, I thought this would be a fun thing to animate.

              - else if (c.key == "equipot")
                p <em>&ldquo;Equipot&rdquo; #{ simulatorSeriesText }</em>
                p Equipotential surfaces for equal charges were seen in my textbook, but I didn&rsquo;t notice one with a positive and equally opposite negative charge. So, I decided to make one.

              - else if (c.key == "shm-simulator")
                p <em>&ldquo;SHM Simulators&rdquo; #{ simulatorSeriesText }</em>
                p My earliest simulation, the one where it all began. I just knew that simple harmonic motion would be fun to look at animated, so I made a simulation where I could easily tinker with the variables and see the formulas.
